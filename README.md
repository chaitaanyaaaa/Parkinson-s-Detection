Parkinson's disease is a progressive nervous system disorder that affects movement leading to shaking, stiffness, and difficulty with walking, balance and coordination.  

Our project aims to revolutionize the early detection and monitoring of Parkinson's Disease, a neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions worldwide. Using advanced machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques, we're developing a non-invasive system that can accurately diagnose and track the progression of Parkinson's Disease.

Through a combination of wearable sensors, medical imaging, and patient data, our project leverages the power of artificial intelligence to detect subtle changes in movement patterns and neurological function indicative of Parkinson's Disease. By analyzing these biomarkers, our goal is to enable healthcare professionals to intervene earlier, personalize treatment plans, and improve the overall quality of life for patients living with Parkinson's Disease.
