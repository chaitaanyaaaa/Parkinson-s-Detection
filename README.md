Parkinson's disease is a progressive nervous system disorder that affects movement leading to shaking, stiffness, and difficulty with walking, balance and coordination.  

Our project aims to revolutionize the early detection and monitoring of Parkinson's Disease, a neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions worldwide. Using advanced machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques, we're developing a non-invasive system that can accurately diagnose and track the progression of Parkinson's Disease.
